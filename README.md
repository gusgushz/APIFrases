# Project "API Frases"

This a personal project in which i attempt to make a API using 
### NODEJS, EXPRESSJS and TypeScript
So i can practice my skills in JS.

This is my very own personal work so it may be errors, it may have
hard-to-read code and bad practices.

Please be patience and bear with me.

Also, english is not my native language so it may be misspells or words
in spanish.

## Update 1
So in update 1, i created the very basics of the API watching some youtube videos.
I worked on make the HTML methods GETall, GETbyId and POST. Also i started the GETall for the admin.
I tried to implement what i learned in classes by creting my folder system. However, i dont know if it´s
really ok, because the names that i learned where different from what i saw on the videos.

## Update 2
So in this update i create the rest of the HTML methods, and also i finally link my JSON as a BD.
Of course im going to jump to a real DB, but for now to test is ok. Also im planing on upload the API.
Right now, all the methods work.

## Update 3 15/Dic/2023
In this update i finally finish my APIREST, with this i meant to say that i have all the 4 methods 
(GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) working. I only have one issue with the PUT. Using thunderclient it updates 
perfectly but sometimes it says "Connection was forcibly closed by a peer", however the input works fine and the data on my JSON is updating as well. So who knows. 
But hey, at least is working.

## Update 4 04/01/2023
In this update i finaly finish the crud for Author. It´s working perfecly, all the methods and requests functions fine. 
In one day i finish almost everything that i left unfinished in vacations (mostly because i was working on a mall). At this point im really proud and exhausted. I dont quite understand everything everything that i´ve done, because i used a videotutorial and chatGPT (3.5).
